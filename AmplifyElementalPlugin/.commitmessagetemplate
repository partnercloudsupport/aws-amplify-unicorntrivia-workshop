Beta v0.4.1
    
Initial plugin to create the elemental resources to host a livestream

- Added the ability to disable MediaPackage - changes made to lambda function in zip and cloudformation ejs
- Fixed the wrong url returning from MediaStore
- Fixed array out of bounds error for get-info if project wasn't pushed or if there were no projects
- Changed default gopPerSegment to 2 per Shawn's suggestion
- Removed console.log

Please note this uses lambda functions to deploy the resources as there is no cloudformation support for elemental yet.
